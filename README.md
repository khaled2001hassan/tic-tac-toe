TIC TAC TOE
By Khaled Hassan & Tasneem Sherif 
This is a game that contains x and Os the winner should do 3 X or O vertically or horizontally or cross 
How to play :
mouse Use Mode 
you can put your X and Os by the use of your mouse just point your mouse arrows on the place you want to insert your X or O in and left click and it will be inserted, once you start the other player will take his turn and insert his X or O and the game continued until one player put 3 X or O vertically or horizontally or in cross way , you can reset your game any time by cliking on the r key in the key-board and start again
Game backgraound:
This is how the game look like and you have 9 squares to insert your X or O
when you win line is been drawn across your winning line 
Plans:
I think I would upgrade the game and have more feature on it like choosing the color that you like and make a championship on this game the winner is who when 3 times on a roll so it needs to add the score
